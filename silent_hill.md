		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>I have a black screen at startup, what can I do?</h1>
          <p>Delete vars_pc.cfg then restart the game. If it doesn't work, disable any compatibility settings you have applied on the game. If still doesn't work, remove any d3d wrapper that hasn't been tested in full game save from start to finish.</p>
		  Also reset your GPU settings to application controlled, do not override any settings. Adaptive V-Sync causes some bugs/glitches.
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>Game crashes when ALT+TABbing.</h1>
          <p>Game will always crash when switching to another app which is what ALT + TAB does.ANY 32 BIT application will crash if you have less than 30% of RAM or love to alt-tab a lot and have a working browser opened.</p>
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>*Game crashes at startup.</h1>
          <p>Game engine is unstable, launch the game up, while it does but don't click anything or do anything till the game loads into main menu.</p>
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>*Game doesn't checkpoint anymore or autosave at certain points of the game!</h1>
          <p>The latest update of 08/09/18 has disabled autosave/checkpoint this is because it caused the game to freeze a long period of time.</p>
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>Game crashes when I go to desktop and go to an app or program.</h1>
          <p>This happens when you switch to apps, the game cannot recover after it has been unfocused by going into desktop and being auto minimized.</p>
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h1>*QTE not responding to the buttons that I'm pressing.</h1>
          <p>The game engine fails to recognise input button when being rapidly pressed. And button counter also going down between delays. For some reason there are button-breaking sequences when you have to press the button at least 100 times.</p>
		  <h1>===========================</h1>
		  <h2>Partially Fixed in v.203</h2>
